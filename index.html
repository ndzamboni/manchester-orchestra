        <h2>Why I love this band</h2>
        <br>
        <p class="lyrics">
            Manchester Orchestra is a band that I listened to during my high school years. 
            Growing up I never really clicked with one particular message or type of music but when I first listened to their album:"I'm like a virgin losing a child", I was absolutely hooked. 
            I would describe Manchester Orchestra's early music as angsty indie rock that had ambigious lyrics that would allow anyone to relate to them and feel the emotion behind them.  
            Listening to some interviews with Andy Hull, I've heard him say that sometimes the lyrics mean something to him but the band allows the listeners to translate that message into what speaks to them directly.

        <h4>Lyrics</h4>
        <p class="lyrics">
            "I don't know where I'm going but I'm going anyways"<br>
            So you leave the apartment, grab the gun under the bed<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            I want to reach above the paradox where nobody can see<br>       
            Want to hold a light to paradigm and strip it to its feet<br>        
            I want to feel the way my father felt, is it easier for me?<br>        
            I want to know if there's a higher love oblivious to me<br>
            <br>
            <br>        
            So you walk in the grocery and you unload several rounds<br>        
            "Don't you dare move a muscle, " cardboard cutout ads<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            I want to reach above the paradox where nobody can see<br>        
            Want to hold a light to paradigm and strip it to its feet<br>        
            I want to feel the way your father felt, was it easy for belief?<br>        
            I want to know if there's a higher love he saw that I can't see<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Looking back, it's obvious now<br>        
            You believe him or you don't<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            So you load up your pistol and you press it to your lips<br>
            And you squeeze on the trigger, all it does is clicks<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            I want to reach above the para-blind where nobody could see<br>
            Want to hold a light to paradise and see if I could sleep<br>
            I want to feel the way our fathers felt when it swept them off their feet<br>
            I want to know about that higher love you saw that can't be seen<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            The only obvious equation, you believe it or you don't<br>
            I've been trying to find the right way to get out of here<br>
            I've been trying to find the right way to get out of here<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            This is the only way to go<br>
            This is the only way<br>
            <br>
            <br>
