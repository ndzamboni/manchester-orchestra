        <h2>About the band</h2>
        <pre class="lyrics">
            Manchester Orchestra is an American indie rock band from Atlanta, Georgia. 
            They were first active in 2004 and are still making music today. 
            The lead man is Andy Hull followed by guitarist Robert McDowell, bassist Andy Prince, and drummer Tim Very.

        <h2>Why I love this band</h2>
        <pre class="lyrics">
            Manchester Orchestra is a band that I listened to during my high school years. 
            Growing up I never really clicked with one particular message or type of music but when I first listened to their album:"I'm like a virgin losing a child", I was absolutely hooked. 
            I would describe Manchester Orchestra's early music as angsty indie rock that had ambigious lyrics that would allow anyone to relate to them and feel the emotion behind them.  
            Listening to some interviews with Andy Hull, I've heard him say that sometimes the lyrics mean something to him but the band allows the listeners to translate that message into what speaks to them directly.

        <pre class="lyrics">
        "I don't know where I'm going but I'm going anyways"
        So you leave the apartment, grab the gun under the bed

        I want to reach above the paradox where nobody can see       
        Want to hold a light to paradigm and strip it to its feet        
        I want to feel the way my father felt, is it easier for me?        
        I want to know if there's a higher love oblivious to me
        
        So you walk in the grocery and you unload several rounds        
        "Don't you dare move a muscle, " cardboard cutout ads
        
        I want to reach above the paradox where nobody can see        
        Want to hold a light to paradigm and strip it to its feet        
        I want to feel the way your father felt, was it easy for belief?        
        I want to know if there's a higher love he saw that I can't see
        
        Looking back, it's obvious now        
        You believe him or you don't
        
        So you load up your pistol and you press it to your lips
        And you squeeze on the trigger, all it does is clicks
        
        I want to reach above the para-blind where nobody could see
        Want to hold a light to paradise and see if I could sleep
        I want to feel the way our fathers felt when it swept them off their feet
        I want to know about that higher love you saw that can't be seen

        The only obvious equation, you believe it or you don't
        I've been trying to find the right way to get out of here
        I've been trying to find the right way to get out of here

        This is the only way to go
        This is the only way
